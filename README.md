<h1>The Oden Library</h1>
This is a Library Project inspired by the "Library" assignment from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">"The Odin Project"</a>.

<h2>Live Preview - https://subhadeepdhar17.github.io/TheOdenLibrary/</h2>

<h4>I have added some additional features other than the ones mentioned in the project assignment.</h4>
<h5>Hope you all like the styling of the project. I kept it minimal with neutral color tones.<br>
Respective comments are added for ease of understanding.<br>
I plan on updating this further into a fully functional library project.</h5>
